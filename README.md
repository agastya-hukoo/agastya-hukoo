# About Me 

- I'm actively learning Arduino for hardware interfacing and Swift for iOS development. 
- Feel free to ask me about Java, basics of programming, or any initial queries you have about getting into coding!

## Skills 

- **Languages**: Java, C, C++, Python
- **Tools**: Currently enhancing my skills in Solidworks and Fusion 360 for CAD and 3D modeling.

## Current Projects

- [Z-Tek_Cubesat_ADCS](https://github.com/ZarvanM/Zarvan_StudentSAT_Open_Source_Cubesat): Contributing to the development of a 3U+ Cubesat featuring a fail-tolerant ADCS, designed strictly for educational and research purposes under the ASLS initiative.

## Learning

- **Arduino**: Exploring Arduino to develop and understand hardware components better.
- **Swift**: Diving into Swift to build and enhance applications on the iOS platform.
